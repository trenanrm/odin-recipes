# odin-recipes
My first Odin Project project!
I used all the basic knowledge of HTML I learned in the previous lessons.
One thing I did to make it easier for myself is to create a basic template page for my recipes so all I had to do was add the content.
I learned a lot about how git works and I am excited to apply what I learned here to my next project!
